On diary A-1, the noting was \"JVD\". This\n  diary was found to be written by one Sri Arvind A. Shah. He was\n  writing the said diary in the capacity of the accountant of the\n  assessee. A statement of Sri Arvind A. Shah u/s. 132(4) was\n  recorded on 20th of October, 2000 and in reply he has stated as\n  under:\n           \"In his statement of Shri Arvind A. Shah u/s. 1323(4) on 20.10.2000\n           on being asked about. Diary A-1 he had submitted that the same\n           pertained to the sharafi business done by Shri Jivrajbhai V. Desai. The\n           relevant portion of his statement is reproduced below:\n            Q.14. I am showing you Annexure A-1 which is seized from your\n           residence. Please explain about the contents therein?\n\n           Ans. It is a ledger account of sharafi financing business done of\n           Jivrajbhai Vastabhai Desai. In this ledger, printed page No.1 is an\n           account of Modi Saheb and the figures mentioned are in thousands\n           i.e. Rs.3,000/- written on the credit side is actually Rs.30,00,000/-.\n           Likewise, whatever figures written in this ledger are written after\n           deleting last three zeros. The debit side figures show the amount\n           returned to the parties by us and credit side figures are sharafi\n           amounts received by us from the parties. The particulars appearing\n           on printed page No.1 to 60 are the parties from who finance have\n           been received by us and the particulars appearing on printed page\n           No.60 to 285 are different parties to whom finance have been given\n           by our group. All figures written in this ledger are in thousands i.e.,\n           written after deleting last three zeros. The figures written nearby the\n           name of party on each page mentions the rate of interest.\"\n\n\n  3.2      The entries in the said diary were deciphered and it was\n  noted that three zeros, i.e., \"000\" have been eliminated in the\n  figures noted in the said diary. On investigation, it was found that\n  there were bank transactions with Mehsana Nagrik Co. Bank,\n  wherein the transaction was inclusive of three zeros, whereas in\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs. ACIT Ahmedabad.\n                                      A.Ys. 1999-00, 2001-02 &amp; 2003-04\n                                    -5-\n\n  the diary the transactions were recorded by the accountant by\n  eliminating last three zeros.\n\n\n  3.3    As per page 234 of diary A-1, the narration noted by the\n  accountant was as under:-\n         \"Page No. 234 of diary A-1 has the following entries:\n         Credit         Date                Narration\n          200        28.8.2000     Mehsana Nagrik Bank, HYP 83\n         2000            31.8.2000            -do-.\"\n\n\n  3.4    Whereas the entries as recorded in the Hyp: Account No.83\n  of Mehsana Nagrik Co. Bank as under:\n         \"Credit        Date            Narration\n\n          200000        28.8.2000      Cash withdrawn\n         2000000        31.8.2000       -do-.\"\n\n\n  3.5    There were several other examples noted by the AO wherein\n  in the like manner the transaction with the bank was recorded in\n  the diary by eliminating last three zeros. After deciphering the\n  figures of the diary the AO has noted that Sri Jivraj V. Desai, the\n  assessee, in his statement dated 20th October, 2000 has accepted\n  that the diary A-1 contained the cash financing business carried out\n  by the assessee. The said statement of the assessee recorded u/s.\n  132(4) dated 20th October, 2000 has further revealed as follows:\n         \"Q-23 Give details of your financial business activities:\n         A-23 Whenever any person comes to us for taking finance we take\n         moral commitment from him on stamp paper or chits, which consists\n         of the period in which the amount is to be returned amount of\n         installment and details of mortgage land, which is in the nature of\n         security. If the above persons return the amount in time, the\n         transaction is considered as completed, and if he does not return the\n         amount in the prescribed time then the possession of mortgaged Land\n         will become ours.

Shri Arvindbhai\n         Shah has stated in Answer No.14 that the figures written are to be\n         read in thousand (for e.g. if the amount is 3,000 if should be read as\n         30,00,000).

The\n  assessee has given the answer in the following manner:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">         \"Q.2 In his statement on 19.9.2002 Shri Arvind Shah has stated that\n         diary similar to A-1 was being maintained by him from 1.11.1997 and\n         1998 which was handed over by him at the time of Diwali to you.\n         A-2.

This agreement is also in the handwriting of Shri\n         Arvind Shah which makes it clear that Arvind Shah knew Shri V.V.\n         Rabari and his statement that he does not know about Shri Rabari is\n         untrue. Shri Arvind Shah every month used to send the diary for\n         perusal of Shri Rabari.\"\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">         Q-3.

I have gone through the details furnished by Shri Arvind Shah\n         in his statement regarding the names noted in diary A-1. From this\n         also it is very clear that Jignesh Desai, Natu Popular, Chhagan Kaka,\n         accounts are related to Thaltej land deal. Other than this account of\n         Shri Manoj Vadodaria noted in diary A-1 also pertains to Thaltej land\n         deal. In these accounts there are contra entries between the accounts\n         of Natu Popular and Manoj Vadodaria. For e/.g/ in annex. A-3 page\n         98 &amp; 99 seized from Arvind Shah's residence there are accounts\n         related to Thaltej land deal which pertained to Natu Popular and\n         Manoj Vadodaria having noting on 17.10.1999. It is from here\n         onwards only that diary like A-1 was being maintained. Further in the\n         seized diary the debit opening balance shown in the account of Manoj\n         Vadodaria pertains to contra entries related to Thaltej land deal. No\n         financial transactions have been done other than this. In this way, the\n         debit balance shown in the account of Shri Manoj Vadodaria in diary\n         A-1 pertains to pending payments related to the Thaltej land deal and\n         as the same were not paid in time accrued interest has also been\n         debited. All payments related to Thaltej land deal were to go to a Trust\n         and I had nothing to do with this. Whatever cash was received was\n         handed over to this Trust and the account of the same is noted in the\n         diary maintained by Shri Arvind Shah. In this way, I have nothing to\n         do with the accrued interest with the account of Shri Manoj\n         Vadodaria. I shall furnish within 2 to 4 days complete details\n         regarding the notings related to Tahltej Vithova Trust land deal in the\n         seized material. Further I shall also establish the length between the\n         seized material and the diary A-1.

Those slips pertained\n  to sharafi loan and in those slips there was a reference of\n  \"Jivrajbhai master\". The AO has noted that those slips have\n  mentioned the name of the assessee. The transaction noted on\n  those slips was made by the assessee in his personal capacity and\n  none of those slips have mentioned the name of the firm, i.e.,\n  \"Master Developers\". According to AO, the sharafi business was\n  carried out by the assessee in his personal capacity and the\n  assessee had over-all control over the income so generated by the\n  unaccounted sharafi business.

Therefore,\n         certain additions made by the AO which has been challenged in this\n         ground of appeal, pertaining to the said land requires to be\n         ignored/deleted.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_50\">         Since the said MOU is an important part of the issue, which has\n         altogether been ignored by the AO for the sake of competence, the\n         Xerox of the said MOU is submitted herewith, for your honour's ready\n         reference:-\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_51\">  4.2    The main contention of the assessee before learned CIT(A)\n  was that the assessee had nothing to do in respect of the said land\n  transaction. The assessee had no interest in any manner in the said\n  land. The transactions were written in the diary by Sri Arvind Shah\n  and the hawala entries were made under the direction of Sri\n  Natubhai Popular and also as per the directions of the land owner.\n  It was submitted that Sri Natubhai and Sri Ramanbhai Patel are\n  known as \"Popular Builders\". They were the buyers of the land.\n  The land belonged to Vithoba Mander Trust and the land was sold\n  on behalf of the Trust by one Mr. Rabari. There is also a mention\n  that part of the land was owned by Sri A.T. Desai. The land was\n  occupied by Sri Chaganbhai Desai. According to assessee, the\n  diary was owned by Sri R.V. Rabari. Mr. Rabari was to receive the\n  payment from Sri Natubhai Patel and Sri Ramanbhai Patel. There\n  was a delay in making a payment as agreed upon hence both the\n  parties have lost the faith in each other. As a result, one Sri Manoj\n  Vadodaria came into picture and acted as a mediator. Sri Manoj\n  Vadodaria has accepted the amount along with interest which was\n  payable to Sri R.V. Rabari being the land owner on behalf Trust.\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs.

The\n  assessee has therefore contested that the diary A-1, in question,\n  had been maintained by Sri Arvind Shah for the purpose of\n  recording the transaction between Sri R.V. Rabari, Sri Natubhai\n  Popular, Sri Jignesbhai Rabari. That the assessee was not\n  connected with the transactions recorded in the diary.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_55\">  4.3    The assessee has explained the working of the addition as\n  made by the AO and the transaction recorded in diary A-1. The\n  transaction recorded in diary A-1 as on 1.11.1999 was at\n  Rs.27,32,38,000/-. The AO has given party-wise detail of the\n  credit side at Rs.6,78,74,600/-. As against that as per AO the total\n  of the debit side was Rs.34,10,92,600/-. The net difference of\n  Rs.27,32,38,000/- was thus considered by the AO and added in the\n  hands of the assessee. The AO has treated the amount as opening\n  balance as on 1.11.1999 which was treated as undisclosed income\n  in the hands of the assessee. The major amount of the debit\n  balance was standing in the name of Sri Manoj Vadodaria. On the\n  other hand, the assessee has argued that the debit entry was\n  nothing but \"havala entry\" pertained to the land transaction.\n  According to assessee, the following amounts related to the land\n  transaction:\n</p>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">        Particulars                Loose paper Amount (Debit)\n                                   page No.\n        Mr. Manoj Vadodaria        134         23,43,08,700\n        Mr. Jignesh V.

Desai as per loose\n  page 104 of Annexure A-1 was not the payment made by the\n  assessee but it was in respect of the land transaction as he\n  happened to be one of the owner of the land. Likewise, the amount\n  of Rs.1,15,29,000/- in the name of Sri Vikasbhai Shah as per loose\n  page 114 of Annexure A-1, it was submitted that initially he had\n  right in the land because at the initial stage the land was sold by\n  R.V. Rabari to Sri Vikasbhai Shah. The assessee has placed\n  reliance on MOU dated 05.07.1998. It was again and again\n  reiterated that the transactions belonged to Sri Jignesh V. Rabari\n  and Sri Natubhai Popular and the assessee has no interest in those\n  transactions. On the other hand, the Revenue Department has\n  contested before learned CIT(A) through several remand reports\n  that the assessee was granted several opportunities in respect of\n  nine ledger account in the diary A-1, but inspite of several\n  opportunities the assessee has not discharged the onus of\n  identifying those parties along with their other details. In the\n  remand report, it was informed to learned CIT(A) that out of those\n  nine parties only three parties have been identified and therefore,\n  notices u/s. 158 BD were respectively issued to those three parties.\n  As regards, the summons issued to Ramanbhai Patel, Jignesh\n  Desai and Manoj Vadodaria, all three of them have expressed their\n  inability to present in compliance of the notices issued u/s. 158BD\n  of IT Act. That fact was informed to the learned CIT(A) through a\n  remand report by the AO. It was informed that one of them\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs.

The accounts in the diary were written on the basis of the\n  chits found at the time of search. It was informed that the account\n  was maintained for full one year and on each Diwali the old ledger\n  was handed over to the assessee and a new ledger was started by\n  the said accountant. Therefore, the opening balance in the new\n  ledger as on 1.11.1999 was the unaccounted investment in the\n  sharafi business by the assessee. Some of the entries in the said\n  diary were made through cheques and those cheque were\n  corroborated by independent evidences hence proved the\n  correctness of the ledger belonging to the assessee. The bank\n  accounts have also tallied with the transactions as recorded in the\n  diary, therefore, that diary was belonging to the assessee.\n  According to Revenue, transactions in the bank account were\n  unaccounted transactions.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_63\">  4.5    Learned CIT(A) has analyzed all those arguments and\n  thereafter arrived at the conclusion as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">         \"5.11 I have carefully considered the facts and the rival submissions\n         and I have also gone through the seized records.

Before\n         coming to the specific amount, which requires to be excluded. I may\n         deal with one of the argument raised by the appellant pertaining to the\n         basis on which addition of Rs.27,32,38,000/- has been made. It has\n         been contended by the appellant that trial balance drawn by the\n         Assessing Officer on the basis of ledger accounts as appearing in the\n         said diary as at 1/11/99, is incorrect and it included certain balance of\n         other dates, is not acceptable for the reasons that in spite of repeated\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

No doubt the appellant has\n         expressed his inability in furnishing the same, but this inability cannot\n         become shelter to the appellant that no addition can be made on this\n         basis. Appellant has admitted in his submissions before me and also in\n         his statement that the said diary contains certain accounts of sharafi\n         transactions which are belonging to him, for which also he could not\n         furnish complete details and therefore, this contention of the appellant\n         is rejected. The other issues raised by the appellant that entire\n         addition is baseless, credits are lower than the debts and therefore no\n         addition is requires to be made are also rejected as these are not\n         supported by any evidences. Therefore, I uphold the basis adopted by\n         the Assessing Officer for the purpose of addition as majority of the\n         ledger accounts appearing in the said diary are having opening\n         balances of 1/11/1999. Coming to the working of the addition, as\n         observed by me herein above that I includes certain accounts which\n         are pertaining to the land, wherein there does not seems to be any\n         financial involvement of the appellant, the same are required to be\n         excluded. In this respect, appellant has made an elaborate submission,\n         pertaining to the account of Shri Manoj Vadodaria, having a debit\n         balance of Rs.23,43,08,700/-. The addition made by the Assessing\n         Officer of Rs.27,32,38,000/- is on account of excess debit over credit\n         balances as per Annexure 0-1, annexed to the assessment order. In\n         support of excluding the balance in the name of Shri Manoj\n         Vadodaria, the appellant has submitted that said Shri Manoj\n         Vadodaria has accepted the responsibility to make the payment to Shri\n         V.V. Rabari and other on behalf of the buyer and therefore, in the said\n         diary the account of Shri Manoj Vadodaria is debited and in turn\n         account of R.V. Rabari &amp; other have been credited. The appellant has\n         also made reference to page 82 of Ann. A-3, which has also been\n         found from the residence of Arvind Shah which is the account with the\n         word 'M' meaning thereby Manoj Vadodaria and co-related the\n         notings on the said page with the said account in the ledger on page\n         134 of the diary at A-1. The said page 82 of A-3 also contains the land\n         area, rate, terms and condition, wherein the final amount has been\n         worked out at Rs.22,36,03,000/- to which brokerage of Rs.25,35,000/-\n         other expenses and legal charges of Rs.11,74,000/- and payment made\n         by Manoj Vadodaris to JAC of Rs.60 lacs making a total\n         Rs.23,33,08,700/-. My attention was also drawn to the ledger account\n         of Manoj Vadodaria as appearing on page 134, wherein two different\n         figures are mentioned, one as 233,308.70 &amp; other as Rs.1,000/- and\n         stated that the first amount of Rs.2,33,308.70 indicates\n         Rs.23,33,08,700/- to which a further amount of Rs.10 lacs has been\n         added being the hawala for the said land and accordingly, a balance\n         of Rs.23,43,08,700/- has been worked out, which has wrongly been\n         added by the Assessing Officer in the hands of the appellant. In view of\n         these direct evidences as found during the course of search, from the\n         residence of Shri Arvind Shah and in absence of any evidences\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

I am of the view that impugned amount requires\n         to be considered in the case of Shri Manoj Vadodaria. Therefore, I am\n         not convinced with the argument raised by the AO in his remand\n         report dated 8/01/2004 that there are no parameters to differentiate\n         these accounts from other account. There are clear cut evidences\n         found at the time of search from the very same person from whom the\n         impugned diary was found, indicating the land transactions and which\n         are also supported by his statement therefore, I am not convinced with\n         the argument of the Assessing Officer in this respect. However, it is an\n         admitted fact that summons have already been issued to Shri Manoj\n         Vadodaria, and notice u/s.158BD has also been issued in his case by\n         the same Assessing Officer, as reported to me in the remand report. In\n         this respect, the submissions of the appellant vide his letter dated\n         14/01/2004 which has been filed pursuance to the remand report dated\n         8/01/2004 and 9/01/2004, requires immediate consideration and\n         therefore, the relevant para of the said submission is reproduced\n         hereinabove. Therefore, out of the total addition made by the\n         Assessing Officer the addition to the extent of Rs.23,43,08,700/- is\n         deleted.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_71\">  5.     Being aggrieved by the afore-reproduced findings of learned\n  CIT(A) now the Revenue is in appeal before us.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_72\">  5.1    From the side of the Revenue, learned D.R. Mr. D.C.\n  Patwari and Shankarlal Meena, D.R. appeared and argued as under\n  (only relevant portion of the written submission reproduced):\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">        \"This para shows that the appellant's statement on 20.10.2000 was\n        also recorded u/s. 132(4) and the diary A-1 as well as statement of Shri\n        Arvind A. Shah of the same date i.e. 20.10.2000 was confronted to the\n        appellant. It is noteworthy that the appellant did not say that the diary\n        had not been maintained only for him. He accepted the fact that the\n        diary was only in respect of him because he stated that he would submit\n        party-wise details personally to the Department subsequently. In fact in\n        Ans. To Q. No.23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 and even in Ans to Q.No.52\n        which are reproduced on page 10 and 11 of the assessment order, it is\n        clear that the appellant has given modus operandi of cash sharafi\n        transactions contained in diary A-1. In Ans. To Q. No.28 on page 11 of\n        the assessment order, this is made very clear that the diary contained\n        information of cash financing business of the appellant. Nowhere the\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs. ACIT Ahmedabad.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">                                      A.Ys. 1999-00, 2001-02 &amp; 2003-04\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                                  - 23 -\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">       appellant has stated that the diary had any other transactions which has\n       been claimed later on and which have been accepted by the CIT(A) even\n       when it was clear from the remand report that the proper inquiry could\n       not be conducted by the AO in the absence of full and proper details. It\n       is very clear that the statement of Arvind A. Shah was confronted to the\n       appellant as stated above and para (e) page 11 of the assessment order\n       shows that in Ans. To Q. No.4, Shri Arvind A. Shah has clearly stated\n       that the appellant alone was in control of the sharafi business and none\n       of the other members of the appellant had a direct connection with the\n       sharafi business. In Ans. To Q. No.5 reproduced on page 12 of the\n       assessment order, Shri Arvind A. Shah has clearly stated that the entire\n       interest income was in the control of Jivrajbhai Desai and nobody could\n       use it without the permission of Jivraj Desai. It means that Master\n       Developers firm where the family members of the appellant are partners\n       was actually in full control of the appellant and of the appellant only\n       and in reality Master Developers was nothing but the appellant himself.\n       Even this statement was not denied by the appellant when the statement\n       of Shri Arvind A. Shah was confronted to him as stated above. However,\n       from September, 2002 onwards, the appellant has suddenly changed the\n       entire submission made earlier i.e. after two years of the search and\n       during the course of assessment proceedings. Both Arvind A. Shah as\n       well as the appellant have almost totally disowns earlier statement and\n       this is clear from page NO.12 of the assessment order. The statement of\n       Arvind A. Shah dated 19.9.2002 and 24.9.2002 shows that the various\n       entries mentioned in diary are being included in respect of accounts\n       related to Thaltej land del. IN the statement of the appellant dated\n       7.10.2002 (page 12 of the assessment order) the appellant has stated\n       that the diary was primarily in respect of Thaltej land deal for which he\n       is only a mediator. It was stated that A-3, Page-11 &amp; 12 has details\n       regarding the sale of Thaltej land and has been signed by the son of the\n       appellant Shri Jignesh Desai. It was stated that this agreement is in the\n       handwriting of Arvind A. Shah which shows that Arvidn A. Shah knows\n       Shri V.V. Rabari and his statement that he did not know Shri Rabari is\n       wrong. The appellant further stated that Shri Arvind A. Shah sent the\n       diary for perusal of Shri Rabari. If these are the facts, then Shri Arvind\n       Shah would have mentioned the things in his first statement recorded on\n       date of search i.e. 20th October, 2000. Neither the appellant nor Shri\n       Arvind Shah made any such statement that in respect of the land deal\n       the appellant is only a mediator. Such an important thing cannot be\n       missed by both of them. In Ans. To Q. No.3 in his statement dated\n       7.10.2002, the appellant has for the first time come up with the\n       argument that Jignesh Desai, Natu Popular, Chhagan Kaka are related\n       to Thaltej land deal and also Manoj Vadodaria whose name is noted in\n       diary A-1. The appellant, therefore, tried to say that the entire land deal\n       was in respect of these people and be himself was only a mediator.\n       Further, interestingly these submissions were made by him by giving the\n       names and addresses which could not be properly verified a they were\n       given only a week earlier to the last date of the assessment order.\n</blockquote><p id=\"p_73\"> IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

On page 18,\n       the appellant has stated that hawala entries have been duly confirmed\n       by Shri Jignesh. It is not understood why Jignesh Rabari harassed the\n       assessee for non payment of bank loan if the assessee was only a\n       mediator and had no interest. The appellant has given break-up of the\n       accounts related to this land which according to the appellant was\n       wrongly considered by the A.O. in the hands of the assessee. These\n       amounts are of Rs.26.80 Crores, major portion in the name of Manoj\n       Vadodaria and balance in the name of Shri Jignesh Desai and Vikas\n       Shah. The appellant has tried to shift the entire burden in the hands of\n       these people in his letter submitted before CIT(A). The various\n       submissions made before CIT(A) are an attempt to shift the entire\n       liability to various people. That this attempt miserably failed which can\n       be seen from the various remand reports quoted by the CIT(A) in his\n       appellate order as under: ..............\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_78\">       In clause (f) it has been submitted by the appellant on page 12 of the\n       CIT(A)'s order of Manoj Vadodaria that the assessee did not given any\n       opportunity to cross examine either Shri Jivraj Desai or any other\n       assessee of his Group. It is very curious that CIT(A) in the case of the\n       appellant has accepted the submission of Jivrajbhai Desai, without\n       asking Shri Jivraj Desai to produce these people on which the\n       responsibility has been shifted. The CIT(A) in the case of the appellant\n       has not even considered it necessary to allow cross examination of\n       these people to the AO and still the entire submission has been\n       accepted. The CIT(A) in the case of Manoj Vadodaria in his order has\n       given the decision as under:\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_79\">       \"14 I have carefully considered the relevant facts and provisions of law\n       with regard to the issue involved. I find that the action against the\n       appellant has been initiated on the strength of documents recovered\n       from 3rd party, i.e. Mr. Jivraj V. Desai and his accountant, Shri\n       Arvindbhai A. Shah. The search action took place en 20.10.2000. The\n       relevant documents are a seized diary - Annexure A-1, loose papers\n       contained in Annexure A-2, A-3 &amp; A-4. The normal presumption\n       u/s.132(4A) is that the documents were belonging to Shri Jivraj V.\n       Desai.\n</p><p id=\"p_80\"> IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

Desai and that\n       these documents indicated sarafi loan transactions and consequential\n       unaccounted investments of Shri Jivraj V. Desai. It is at a very late\n       stage that Shri Jivraj V. Desai came forward with the theory that the\n       diary marked Annexure A-1 was maintained by Shri Arvindbhai A.\n       Shah at the instance of some other persons.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_84\">       The plea of the appellant in this regard finds due support from the\n       landmark judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/320053/\" id=\"a_2\">CBI Vs.\n       V.C. Shukla &amp; Others</a> reported in 3 SC cases - 410, wherein the Apex\n       Court clearly laid down that entries in the documents maintained by a\n       3rd party had only probative value and such entries alone were not\n       sufficient to charge any person with a liability. Corroborative\n       independent evidences were essential to establish trustworthiness of\n       such entries in order to fasten a liability on a person. The case of the\n       appellant also finds support from the decision of Hon'ble Mumbai High\n       Court in the case of Addl. CIT Vs. Lata Mangeshwar 97 ITR 696\n       (Mumbai). I, therefore, hold that the entries in the documents recovered\n       from Shri Jivraj V. Desai and his accountant Shri Arvindbhai A. Shah in\n       themselves were not sufficient to fasten a liability on the appellant. The\n       various grounds of appeal raised by the appellant are therefore,\n       decided on the basis of above adjudication.\"\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_85\">  6.     On the strength of these arguments, learned D.R. Shri D.C.\n  Patwari and Shankarlal Meena, have vehemently pleaded that the\n  assessee had taken the U-turn without any basis. At the time of\n  hearing he had given the statement in respect of his unaccounted\n  sharafi business; but later on concocted the story of Thaltej land\n  deal. In the absence of any evidence found in the search operation\n  to support that contention, the same should be rejected.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_86\">  7.     From the side of the assessee, learned AR, Mr. G.C. Pipara\n  appeared and argued that the main transaction which was noted in\n  the diary was in respect of the land transaction of Vitthoba Mandir\n  Trust, of which Sri R.V. Rabari and brother Sri V.V. Rabari are the\n  trustees. The said land was agreed to be sold by Sri R.V. Rabari to\n  Sri Natubhai Patel of M/s. Popular Builders. The said MOU dated\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs. ACIT Ahmedabad.\n</p><p id=\"p_87\">                                      A.Ys. 1999-00, 2001-02 &amp; 2003-04\n</p><p id=\"p_88\">                                 - 26 -\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_89\">  5.7.1998 was found at the time of search from the residence of Sri\n  Arvind Shah. Because the entries in the said diary were supported\n  by an evidence, i.e., MOU dated 5.7.1998, therefore, the contents\n  of the diary were recorded in support of the land transaction. It was\n  wrong on the part of the AO to treat the transaction recorded in the\n  diary as sharafi business of the assessee. From the documents\n  seized, it was clear that Sri R.V. Rabari and others were required\n  to receive payment from Sri Natubhai Patel and Sri Ramanbhai\n  Patel; but there was a delay in making the payment as agreed upon,\n  therefore, both the parties have lost faith in each other. As a result,\n  later on Sri Manoj Vadodaria came into picture and he was\n  accepted as a mediator. He has referred page 82 of Annexure A-3.\n  Learned AR has vehemently contested that it was wrong on the\n  part of the AO to hold that Rs.23,43,08,700/- was paid to Sri\n  Manoj Vadodaria. Rather, the assessee had not paid any amount to\n  Sri Manoj Vadodaria. In his name in the diary there was only\n  hawala entry in respect of the said land wherein Sri Manoj had\n  accepted the responsibility of making payment on behalf of Sri\n  Natubhai Patel to Sri V.V. Rabari. Learned AR has also pleaded\n  that the admitted factual position was that the transactions in diary\n  A-1 was recorded by the said accountant on the basis of the chits\n  recovered from his possession. According to learned AR, it is\n  significant to note that none of the chits were signed by the\n  assessee. In support of these arguments, learned AR has cited\n  following decisions and the comments were as under:\n</p><p id=\"p_90\">       \"10.

We have heard the submissions of both the sides. We have\n  perused the voluminous material placed before us. At first, it is\n  important to mention that a statement recorded u/s. 132(4) has\n  significant evidentiary value, which was recorded during the\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

We are also of the opinion\n  that once a statement was made in the presence of the witnesses at\n  the time of search and that there was no element of inducement or\n  coercion then that statement being based upon the evidences\n  collected during the course of search; is a true and correct\n  statement unless and until proved otherwise. In general, there is no\n  scope under the existing law to alter that statement. We have noted\n  that a statement of Sri Arvind A. Shah u/s. 132(4) was recorded on\n  20th October, 2000. Since, a diary A-1 was recovered from his\n  possession, therefore, certain questions were asked in respect of\n  the said diary. The Diary is titled as \"JVD\" maintained for the\n  period 1.11.99 to 15.10.2000. The date of search is 20.10.2000.\n  The diary has single entry ledger account of various sharafi\n  business related parties. The Revenue had shown the said diary to\n  Sri Arvind A. Shah which was recovered from him and asked to\n  explain the contents of the said diary. Sri Arvind A. Shah has\n  answered     that   the   diary   was    a    \"ledger   account\"       of\n  sharafi/financing\" business of the assessee, namely, Jivrajbhai\n  Vasantbhai Desai. He has also informed that three zeros (000) was\n  to be added in the figures written in the diary. He has also\n  explained that the \"debit\" side showed the figures of sharafi\n  amount given by the assessee or returned by the assessee to the\n  parties. The \"credit\" side figures are sharafi amount received by\n  the assessee from those parties. He has further explained that the\n  particulars bearing on the printed pages 1 to 16 are the parties from\n  whom the finance have been received by the assessee and\n  particulars bearing on printed page nos.62 to 85 are the details of\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

It has also\n  been stated by Sri Shah that the rate of interest has also been\n  mentioned in those accounts. In the light of the said statement of\n  Sri Shah, we have carefully perused the photocopy of the said\n  diary, being a part of the compilation as well as an English version\n  of the said diary placed before us from the side of the Revenue.\n  We have noted that a party-wise index was made in the beginning\n  of the diary. Then party-wise ledger accounts of those parties have\n  started. For eg., at page 1 there is an account of one \"Modi Saheb\".\n  At page no.2 is the account of \"Ganeshbhai\". On page 3 \"Amthalal\n  Desai\", so and so forth. Our attention has been drawn on pages\n  134, 135, 136, 137 mentioning the account of \"Manojbhai\n  Vodadaria.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_106\">  8.1    On the basis of the scrutiny of this diary one thing is\n  apparent that the same had been written in a systematic manner.\n  The amount given by the assessee were debited in the account of\n  the said person and when the amount was received by the assessee\n  from those parties the account of the said party was credited.\n  Therefore, the entries of the Diary is required to be adjudged by\n  juxtaposing with the statements recorded u/s. 132(4) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_6\">IT Act</a> of\n  the assessee and the accountant. A statement is a declaration hence\n  it's contents can not be and should not be substituted by an\n  opinion. It is to be read wholly because as per sec 132(4) the\n  Authorised officer; during the course of search; examine the\n  persons on oath in respect of the accounts, documents, money,\n  jewellery etc. found from the said persons possession. Further as\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs.

The accountant Sri Arvind A. Shah has affirmed that the\n  diary was written in his handwriting and \"JVD\" stands for\n  Jivrajbhai Vasantbhai Desai, i.e., the assessee. Further to\n  corroborate the figures noted in the diary with bank accounts, it\n  was also inquired by the Revenue Department from the bank and\n  on inquiry it was found that the entries reflected in the diary have\n  matched with the bank statement. The AO has checked those\n  entries; which have been matched with the Mehsana Nagrik Co-\n  operative Bank (Hyp. A/c-83). The only difference was the last\n  three zeros (000) not recorded in A-1 diary. The Revenue\n  Department has, therefore, made efforts to establish that the\n  accounts were conclusively belonging to the assessee and the\n  assessee was held responsible to explain the nature of transaction\n  with corroborative evidence.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_111\">  8.3    The assessee was thus also confronted with the said diary A-\n  1 on the date of search on 20th October, 2000. According to AO, on\n  that date the assessee had accepted that the diary contained the\n  unaccounted cash finance business. In the said statement recorded\n  on 20th of October, 2000 u/s. 132(4) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_8\">IT Act</a>, the assessee has\n  stated in his answer No.23 that whenever a person asked for the\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs. ACIT Ahmedabad.\n</p><p id=\"p_112\">                                      A.Ys. 1999-00, 2001-02 &amp; 2003-04\n</p><p id=\"p_113\">                               - 31 -\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_114\">  finance then a moral commitment on stamp paper was taken from\n  him. Sometime \"chits\" have also been made wherein the period of\n  the finance; the amount of the finance; the period of return of the\n  finance; amount of installment, details of mortgaged land which is\n  in the nature of security, etc. are noted. Rather, it was stated in that\n  said statement by the assessee that in a situation when the amount\n  was not returned within the prescribed time then the assessee took\n  over the possession over the mortgaged land. An another fact was\n  revealed that the rate of interest was based upon the title of the\n  land as also the time of repayment of the amount. It was elaborated\n  by the assessee in the said statement that the minimum rate of\n  interest charged @ 2% but if the title of the land happened to be\n  not clear then the interest was charged @ 3% or more. In an\n  answer no.28 the assessee has admitted that the information\n  contained in the diary was in respect is \"cash finance business\".\n  The details contained in the diary were in respect of the loans\n  given and the interest charged from the parties. In an answer to\n  question no.52, the assessee has also given an undertaking that the\n  estimated income of different development activities shall be\n  informed. The assessee has also given an undertaking that the\n  sharafi income shall be worked out on the basis of the diary A-1\n  seized from the residence of the accountant Sri Arvind A. Shah.\n  On perusal of the said statement, it is clear that at that point of time\n  the assessee had accepted the fact that he was engaged in \"sharafi\n  business\". The assessee has also accepted the fact that the\n  transaction of the sharafi business was recorded by the accountant\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

Due to the\n  change of the said statement the present controversy is addressed\n  to us. The entire controversy revolved around the fact that the\n  assessee had changed his stand during the assessment stage. There\n  were three segments as far as the arguments on facts are\n  concerned. First segment is about the evidences collected at the\n  time of search, second segment is the statements recorded in the\n  light of those evidences and the third segment is the retraction\n  made before the Assessing Officer.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_119\">  8.5    As far as the evidences collected at the time of search are\n  concerned the main material was a diary which was titled as\n  'JVD'. On the basis of abbreviation written it was held by the\n  Revenue Department that the diary belonged to the assessee,\n  namely, Jivraj V. Desai. The admitted factual position is that this\n  diary had been written by one Sri Arvind A. Shah. This diary was\n  recovered from his residence. Naturally, a statement was required\n  to be recorded of Sri Arvind A. Shah because the said diary was\n  written by him and the same was recovered from his residence. As\n  per his statement recorded u/s. 132(4) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_9\">IT Act</a>, dated 20th of\n  October, 2000, he has admitted that the diary contained the sharafi\n  business of Shri Jivrajbhai Vastabhai Desai, i.e. the assessee. He\n  has also clarified that last three zeroes were omitted while writing\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs. ACIT Ahmedabad.\n</p><p id=\"p_120\">                                      A.Ys. 1999-00, 2001-02 &amp; 2003-04\n</p><p id=\"p_121\">                               - 33 -\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_122\">  the figures in the said diary as the same was in the coded language.\n  He has also explained that the ledger accounts of each party are\n  maintained according to which in the debit side the figures noted\n  are the amounts given to the parties for sharafi financing business\n  and the credit side figures noted in the ledger accounts are in\n  respect of sharafi amount received by the assessee from those\n  parties. On the basis of the said statement, the Revenue\n  Department had proceeded further to investigate the correctness of\n  the transaction recorded in the said diary. So as to ascertain\n  whether the diary belonged to the assessee or not, the AO had\n  inquired from Mehsana Nagrik Bank and it was found that the\n  entries recorded at page no.234 of diary A-1 have matched with\n  the entries recorded by the said bank. Since, the bank statement\n  and the entries recorded therein have matched with the entries in\n  the said diary, therefore, it was concluded by the Revenue\n  Department that the entries recorded in the diary pertained to the\n  assessee because those banks entries also pertained to the assessee.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_123\">  8.6    The second segment is that an important fact has also been\n  noted by us that statement of the assessee was also recorded on\n  20th of October, 2000 and in that statement during the course of\n  search in an answer to question no.23 the assessee had admitted\n  that he happened to be in sharafi business. He has stated that\n  whenever any person approaches for taking finance then a moral\n  commitment is taken on stamp paper or on the chits. On the chits\n  the period for which the amount is taken on loan is noted and the\n  time by which the amount is credited to be returned is noted along\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

The loan is\n  granted against the mortgage of the land. The mortgaged land is in\n  the nature of a security taken by the assessee if the amount is\n  returned or the loan is repaid within the time granted then the\n  transaction was considered as completed. If the amount of loan is\n  not returned by the said party within the prescribed time then the\n  possession over the mortgaged land was taken by the assessee.\n  This fact was affirmed by him, quote, \"possession of mortgaged\n  land will become ours\" unquote. In his statement the assessee has\n  also affirmed that the rate of interest is decided upon the facts such\n  as possession of land, title clearance and the time given for the\n  repayment of amount. He has informed in the said statement that\n  the rate of interest was from 2% up to 3%. The assessee has also\n  accepted at that time that Sri Arvind A. Shah is writing the said\n  diary and he used to visit the office of the assessee once in a\n  month. His statement was recorded only after showing the said\n  diary to the assessee during the course of search operation. In an\n  answer to question no.28 the assessee has reiterated that the\n  information in the said diary was in respect of the \"cash financing\n  business\". He had made an offer to declare the income of the\n  sharafi business later on. Rather the appellant had told the search\n  party that the actual estimated figure of the said income could not\n  be offered at that point of time but to be declared later on after\n  having the complete details. The assessee had thus made a\n  statement that he will estimate the transaction of sharafi business\n  and shall work out the sharafi business in the light of the seized\n  diary A-1.\n</p><p id=\"p_127\"> IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

Later on during the\n  assessment proceedings the assessee had taken a turtle-turn. In a\n  statement which were recorded u/s.131 during the course of\n  assessment proceedings the assessee had retracted from the said\n  statement which was recorded at the time of search. On one hand\n  the assessee had denied the sharafi business, but on the other hand,\n  even during the course of assessment proceedings when an another\n  statement u/s.131 was recorded of Sri Arvind A. Shah on\n  19.9.2002 and 24.09.2002, he has re-affirmed that the full control\n  over the \"sharafi business\" was in the hands of the assessee alone.\n  Only on the instructions of the assessee the money could be given\n  on loan on interest. The said accountant has also informed that\n  none of the other members had connecton with the sharafit\n  business and the assessee only had the control over the business.\n  But the assessee had not accepted that statement of the accountant\n  and the evidences. In a statement before the AO the assessee has\n  stated that the diary contained the accounts related to a \"Thaltej\n  land deal\". According to him, he was a mediator in the said deal.\n  As per the statement of the assessee the account of Sri Jignesh\n  Desai, Sri Natu Popular, Sri Chhagan Kaka were related to the\n  Thaltej land deal. According to the statement of the assessee made\n  before the AO even the action of Sri Manoj Vadodaria pertained to\n  the Thaltej land deal. According to assessee, the debit balance\n  shown in the account of Sri Manoj Vadodaria pertained to the\n  pending payment related to the Thaltej land deal. In short the\n  emphasis of the assessee was that the payment was related to the\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

He has also denied that he had anything to do with the\n  accrued interest.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_134\">  8.8    Due to the said changed statement of the assessee, the AO\n  had again confronted the assessee with the existences of the slips,\n  i.e., \"chitti\", recovered at the time of search. In those chitti the loan\n  transaction was recorded and the reference has been made as\n  \"Jivrajbhai Master\". According to AO, the chits were written in\n  personal capacity by the assessee and those were not related to a\n  firm \"Master Developers\" as alleged. The AO had informed the\n  assessee that the business of M/s. Master Developers was not\n  \"financing\" but \"construction\" business. The AO had specifically\n  informed the assessee that no corroborative documentary\n  evidences was submitted by the assessee to substantiate the said\n  claim. We, therefore, hold that an assertion is meaningless if not\n  supported by cogent evidence.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_135\">  8.9.   Now we shall discuss the third aspect of the case. On one\n  hand, although, the evidences and the statements were elaborately\n  discussed by the AO but we have noted that on the other hand, the\n  learned CIT(A) has not dealt with all those evidences which were\n  collected at the time of search. Learned CIT(A) has called for a\n  remand report and in the said remand report the Revenue\n  Department had strongly supported the addition made by the AO.\n  It was informed to learned CIT(A) that in respect of the nine ledger\n  accounts in the said diary A-1 the assessee was granted several\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

Rather, the Revenue Department\n  had informed the learned CIT(A) that the parties which were\n  identified were issued notices as prescribed u/s. 158BD of IT Act.\n  Revenue Department had made certain attempts to interrogate\n  some of the parties but the assessee had not co-operated.\n  According to us, learned CIT(A) has not taken the cognizane of the\n  statement recorded u/s. 132(4) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_10\">IT Act</a> but taken the cognizance\n  of the statement recorded u/s. 131 of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_11\">IT Act</a> which was recorded\n  during the course of assessment proceedings. We are not in\n  agreement with the said approach of learned CIT(A). Rather, in\n  para 5.11 and para 5.12 learned CIT(A) commented that still the\n  AO had preferred to make the addition in the hands of the assessee\n  on the basis of the said diary without excluding the transactions\n  pertained to the said land which were informed by the assessee as\n  per the statement recorded u/s 131 of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_12\">IT Act</a>. This observation of\n  learned CIT(A) is in contradiction with the law as well as the fact.\n  According to us, the assessee was under strict obligation to\n  discharge the primary onus. The legal aspect of the mater\n  therefore, also to be discussed but in brief hereunder.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_139\">  8.10 According to our humble understanding of law the power to\n  interrogate on oath is conferred u/s. 132(4) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_13\">IT Act</a>.

In the present case, we have noted that\n  the statement u/s.132(4) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_14\">IT Act</a> of the assessee was recorded\n  after showing him the said diary. A statement u/s. 132(4) being a\n  statement on oath thus can be used as an evidence against the\n  person who had made the statement. The only exception is that if\n  the assessee wants to challenge that statement on oath then he has\n  to place on record a strong evidence in support of the rebuttal. Law\n  has permitted to challenge an admission if made inadvertently and\n  then it is open for the deponent to show that the said admission\n  was not factually a correct deposition. But the said deponent is\n  under strict obligation to adduce evidence to prove his inadvertent\n  admission. We are of the view that it is incumbent on the deponent\n  to substantiate his rebuttal with strong cogent evidences. In the\n  absence of such evidences the rebuttal is nothing but merely a\n  verbosity. In the present case, we have noted that learned CIT(A)\n  has overlooked the statement recorded u/s. 132(4) of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_15\">IT Act</a> and\n  given undue weightage to the statement recorded u/s. 131 of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_16\">IT\n  Act</a> which were otherwise not supported by evidence. At this\n  juncture we may like to further clarify that the evidences are those\n  evidences which are found at the time of search in search related\n  matters. The entire proceeding revolved around the evidences or\n  documents found in the possession, and unearthed at the time of\n  search; so as to demonstrate that the diary A-1 was belonging to\n  the assessee and not to any third person. To buttress there was a\n  statement of the accountant. Additionally; the nature of the\n  transactions recorded in the said diary were so explicit that the\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

Further as per <a href=\"/doc/500824/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n  132(4A)(ii)</a> an another presumption is that the contents of such\n  books of accounts and other document are true. This presumption\n  can be rebutted by the assessee, but the rebuttal is also to be\n  supported by cogent evidence. One of the strong contentions of the\n  Revenue Department was that the assessee had admitted that the\n  finance was given against the security of land. The transactions\n  otherwise recorded in the diary and have found recorded in the\n  chits, thus also clearly demonstrated that the land was taken as a\n  security by the assessee while advancing money to the borrowers.\n  Therefore, the conclusion is that the Thaltej land was also\n  connected with the sharafi business and the assessee was\n  monitoring the land transaction so as to secure his loan advanced\n  to the parties as noted in the diary. Learned CIT(A) has not looked\n  in this aspect and unilaterally held that the amount which was\n  recorded was required to be considered in the case of one Sri\n  Manoj Vadodaria. This decision of learned CIT(A) appears to be\n  incorrect because on his part in the absence of perusal of the case\n  record of Sri Manoj Vadodaria, it was not justifiable for CIT(A) to\n  take decision by appreciating the facts of one side only.

Learned CIT(A) has noted that the interest income\n  was required to be enhanced and for which a notice of\n  enhancement was also given to the assessee. However, learned\n  CIT(A) has also observed that out of the correct interest of\n  Rs.8,29,09,450/- the interest in the name of Sri Manoj Vadodaria\n  of Rs.6,10,86,200/- and interest in the name of one Sri Jignesh V.\n  Desai of Rs.14,92,700/- required to be excluded from the hands of\n  the assessee. According to learned CIT(A), the said interest was\n  related to the land transaction at Thaltej. However, learned CIT(A)\n  has rejected an another submission of the assessee to reduce the\n  interest pertained to Rajubhai Desai, A. T. Desai, B.M.\n  Mangukaya on the ground that the said claim was not supported by\n  documentary evidence. In his opinion those persons were not\n  related to the land deal. In short out of total amount of interest; as\n  computed by learned CIT(A) of Rs.8,29,09,450/-; a relief of\n  Rs.6,28,95,780/- was granted. Learned CIT(A) has further granted\n  relief in respect of interest calculation of and thereafter confirmed\n  the addition to the extent of Rs.1,79,06,430/- as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">         \"Coming to the addition of Rs. 7,80,09,480/- pertaining to interest on\n         sarafi transactions.

Those documents were\n  found from the residence of the said accountant in respect of sale\n  of flats and basements of Savit Park. According to evidences, the\n  total payment due from Sri Chaagan Kaka was Rs.1,41,00,000/- as\n  per the account maintained in the diary. In the said account there\n  was detail of the balance payment as well noted. The AO has,\n  therefore, made a conclusion that in the light of the details of the\n  payment recorded the sale of the flat was duly confirmed and sale\n  was not merely a draft but the flats were indeed sold to Chaagan\n  Kaka by the assessee for a sum of Rs.1,21,15,000/-.

Following the said\n         finding and in view of evidences furnished in that case, the finding of\n         the AO that these properties are benami properties were cancelled by\n         me. Therefore, in view of the above facts, the addition of\n         Rs.1,21,15,000/- is deleted from the hands of the appellant and same is\n         required to be considered in the case of M/s.

Further the entry of Rs.12115000 is related to the account\n         of Shri Jignesh V. Desai and pertains to the Thaltej land. This Isanpur\n         site account has been maintained till 20.10.2000 and the last credit\n         entry is dt.25.7.2000 and till that date the credit entry of Rs.12115000\n         has not been reversed. This once again emphasizes that the sale of\n         flats as per the agreement on page-18 A-3 did go through and it is not\n         a mere draft deed. Further Shri Arvind Desai in his statement dated\n         19.9.2002 has clarified that the accounts maintained in the diary A-1\n         were maintained under your supervision and frequently the accounts\n         in the diary were examined by you.

As per\n         submission of Arvind A. Shah these were prepared by him for your\n         perusal so that you could exercise control over the business and\n         supervise the maintenance of accounts.

Under the fitness of circumstances and considering the\n  totality of the facts we deem it proper to restore this issue back to\n  AO to examine afresh the correct factual position after having a\n  field enquiry and get the correct information about the ownership\n  of the property.

When the matter was carried before the learned CIT(A), it\n  was held as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">         \"I have considered the facts and rival contentions. The addition of\n         Rs.22,48,000/- is based on notings on page 251 of A-6 and page 46 of\n         A-7. the first addition is pertaining to noting on page 251 of Annexure\n         A-6 for an amount of Rs.22,48,000/-. Assessing officer has observed\n         on page 43 that out of the total payment found noted as loose papers\n         of Rs/22,48,000/-, Rs. 10 lacs has been shown and therefore, the\n         balance amount of Rs.12,48,000/- has been added by the Assessing\n         Officer. Referring to the reply which has been reproduced by the\n         Assessing Officer on page 45 &amp; 46, it has been contended that only\n         70% of the said land has been purchased by the appellant and his\n         group and accordingly, the amount comes to Rs.15,73,000/- as against\n         which it has been claimed that total payment made by the family\n         member is Rs.20,69,000/- and therefore, it was argued that no\n         addition is required to be made. I am not convinced with the argument\n         of 70% as no documentary evidence has been brought on record.\n         Therefore, considering the total payment of Rs.22,48,000/-, out of\n         which an amount of Rs.10 lacs paid by the appellant credit of which\n         has been given by the Assessing officer, the balance works out to Rs.\n         12,48,000/-, out of this an amount of Rs.10,99,000/- has been invested\n         by the four family members. Necessary evidences in proof of this being\n         copy of the land account, balance sheet where the impugned account\n         has been shown, have been filed which are placed on page 89 to 93 of\n         the paper book. Even before he Assessing officer this contention has\n         been raised that the total payment made by the family is\n         Rs.20,69,000/- which has not been controverted by the Assessing\n         Officer. Therefore, out of the addition made by the Assessing officer of\n         Rs.12,48,000/-, investment made by the four family members of\n         Rs.10,99,000/- as per details given in the submission as reproduced\n         hereinabove requires to be considered in the case of those four family\n         members and therefore, balance amount of Rs.1,49,000/- is considered\n         as the investment made by the appellant outside books and confirmed.\n         During the course of appeal, an alternate submission has been raised\n         that if any addition is confirmed on this account, same is not\n         separately required to be added in view of separate addition on\n         account of notings in diary A-1 pertaining to loans and interest\n         income.

When the matter carried before learned CIT(A), it was\n  contended that there was land ceiling problems and also some\n  dispute, hence, the transaction was incomplete.

In\n         Clause No.5 it is also mentioned that in the said land one case under\n         \"Ganot\" is undergoing and if the judgment in favour, the said land\n         title will be clear and marketable. In Clause no.6, it is further\n         mentioned that possession shall be given at the time of registered sale\n         deed. Therefore, it is absolutely clear that no evidences were found at\n         the time of search indicating payment exceeding Rs.5,00,000/-.\n         However, the appellant has admitted that a total of Rs.7,00,000/- has\n         been paid in all by the 6 owners and therefore, the appellant's share\n         was only Rs.1,17,000/-, which has already been disclosed by the\n         appellant in VDIS and therefore, no addition is required to be made.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_232\">  25.1 After appreciating those evidences, learned CIT(A) has held\n  as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">         \"I have considered the facts and gone through the banakhat being\n         loose page 98 to 106 of Annexure A-109 found from the residence of\n         appellant.

The contention raised before the\n         Assessing Officer is also similar. No evidences have been brought on\n         record by the Assessing Officer that any further payment has been\n         made. Therefore, at the outset, the only payment which can be\n         considered for the purpose of addition is Rs.5 lacs, as found noted in\n         the very same banakhat. Since appellant himself has admitted that\n         total payment is of Rs.7 lacs and 1/6th thereof Rs.1,17,000/- which, has\n         been paid by the appellant and therefore, this amount is required to be\n         considered only as against Rs.50 lacs considered by the Assessing\n         Officer for the purpose of addition. Coming to the source of\n         Rs.1,17,000/- which has been claimed as having been disclosed in\n         VDIS. I have carefully gone through the declaration made by the\n         appellant for VDIS and the relevant papers which are placed on page\n         109 to 118 of the paper book and from the perusal of the same, it is\n         absolutely clear that no amount has been disclosed by the appellant\n         pertaining to land at Wadaj and therefore, the contention of the\n         appellant that impugned amount of Rs.1,17,000/- has been disclosed in\n         VDIS is found to be incorrect. Thus, the addition of Rs.1,17,000/- is\n         confirmed out of the total addition made by the AO of Rs.50 lacs. The\n         benefit for the set off is also not available to the appellant as payment\n         has been made on 21.10.1995, whereas no income has been accrued to\n         the appellant till this date as per diary Annexure A-1, and therefore,\n         the alternate contention raised by the appellant is also rejected.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_233\">  26.    Having heard the submissions of both the sides and on due\n  consideration of the evidences; we are of the view that since in the\n  clauses of the Banakhat there was mention of payment of Rs.5 lacs\n  and that there was a mention of the dispute as also the problem of\n  Land Ceiling hence deal was not finalized rather stated to be\n  cancelled later on; hence there was no infirmity in the part relief\n  granted by learned CIT(A).

Since the nature of both the issue is\n         identical, the learned CIT(A) ought to have allowed relief of\n         Rs.61,78,300/- from the total addition confirmed.\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_280\">         9.

Since no such income has been earned\n         by the appellant, the resultant addition requires to be deleted.

However, no separate addition has been made on the\n         ground that the same has been incurred out of income already added\n         by the A.O.

Learned AR Mr. G.C. Pipara, at the outset has informed that\n  the assessee is not willing to press ground nos.1, 2, 3, 9, 15, 17 to\n  21, hence, no adjudication is required. These grounds being not\n  pressed, hence, hereby dismissed being not contested by the\n  assessee.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_300\">  41.    Apropos to ground nos.4 and 5, it is worth to mention that\n  the related facts have already been discussed above while deciding\n  the appeal of the Revenue. A diary was recovered and on the basis\n  of the entries found recorded in the said diary a trial balance was\n  drawn. That trial balance was taken into account by the AO,\n  especially when no defect was pointed out by the assessee. Even\n  for the block period if on the opening day it was found that there\n  were undisclosed investment then those undisclosed investment\n  are required to be taxed in the hands of the assessee for the said\n  block period. We have also given a finding that on account of the\n  nature of the entries made in the diary, the impugned diary in fact\n  belonged to the assessee. As far as the argument that the credits\n  were lower than the debits is concerned, we have closely examined\n  this aspect as well. The AO has reproduced a statement of Sri\n  Arvind A. Shah on page 8 of the assessment order wherein he has\n  accepted that the debits side figures represented the amount given\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

Therefore, the amounts which were\n  advanced as loan was found excessive than the amounts\n  representing the credit side, which were the amounts received from\n  the parties. Therefore, in the finance business the credit sides were\n  generally lower because the parties have not refunded or returned\n  the loan amount and hence the debit side entries represented the\n  higher figure because the advances given by the assessee as a loan\n  to various parties had represented the higher figure. Under the\n  totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, we find no force\n  in ground nos.4 and 5 of the assessee hence the same are hereby\n  dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_304\">  42.    Apropos to ground no.6, in the light of the discussion made\n  hereinabove since the same was nothing but connected with sharafi\n  transaction of the assessee, hence, in view our decision taken while\n  deciding Revenue's ground no.1, we hereby reject this ground of\n  the assessee. In the result, ground no.6 of the assessee is hereby\n  dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_305\">  43.

Since this amount of Rs.77,47,500/-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_306\">         has not been added by the Assessing Officer as he has given credit for\n         the same, a notice of enhancement of the income by Rs.77,47,500/- has\n         been given to the Authorised representative of the appellant to which\n         the appellant in his written submission dated 9/01/2004 has agreed for\n         the same but has raised a contention that there is a similar addition of\n         Rs.61,78,300/- in the name of Shri Chhaganbhai Desai, which\n         requires to be deleted as the said debit balance in the name of Sri\n         Chhaganbhai Desai is pertaining to the land at Thaltej and there are\n         no sharafi transactions in the said account. It was further submitted\n         that no documentary evidences were found at the time of search from\n         Shri Arvind A Shah pertaining to the buyer and Shri Chhaganbhai\n         Desai and therefore, no submissions were made in detail pertaining to\n         addition of Rs.61,78,300/- in the name of Sri Chhaganbhai Desai. I\n         have looked into the ledger account of Shri Chhaganbhai Desai as\n         appearing in the said diary and from the perusal of the same. It is\n         found that except opening balance there is no credit and further debits\n         are only on account of interest and even the rate of interest i.e., 2.5%\n         per month is written on that page which shows that the account is a\n         loan account and submission that Shri Chhaganbhai Desai is the\n         occupier of the said land having ownership is potently incorrect. It is\n         seen that on various sharafi transactions in the diary specific rates of\n         interest varying between 2.10% to 4.5% are mentioned and in the\n         account of Shri chhaganbhai Desai rate of 2.5% is clearly written and\n         interest has also been worked out at the same rate every month. This\n         shows that the submissions are wrong and there is no evidence to\n         show that he was part owner of land. Thus no deduction of this amount\n         can be allowed. The appellant has claimed certain deduction for the\n         balances other than 1/11/99, which is rejected as the appellant has not\n         furnished the said ledger on a double entry basis. The claim of the\n         appellant pertaining to bad debts in respect of Piyushbhai Thakrshi\n         and other parties is also rejected as no evidences could be brought on\n         record in support of his claim. Besides this I find that name of these\n         accounts have been written off as bad debts in the seized documents or\n         any where and I also find that in many accounts even interest after the\n         date of search has been worked out. This shows that these were not\n         bad debts even till the date of search. In the remand report dated\n         09/01/2004 the learned Addl. CIT has raised the contention regarding\n         presumptions u/s. 132(4A) and stressed that addition requires to be\n         confirmed in the hands of the appellant. In this respect, the appellant\n         has also made a submission relying upon certain judgments, which\n         has also been reproduced by me hereinabove. However, it may be seen\n         that in <a href=\"/doc/843732/\" id=\"a_26\">section 132(4A)</a> the words \"may be presumed\" have been\n         employed. It is, therefore, clear that the making of the presumption in\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs. ACIT Ahmedabad.\n</p><p id=\"p_307\">                                      A.Ys. 1999-00, 2001-02 &amp; 2003-04\n</p><p id=\"p_308\">                                  - 71 -\n</p><p id=\"p_309\">         such cases depends upon the particular fact of the case. The officer or\n         authority is not justified to make such presumption in all cases without\n         judicial application of mind to the facts of the particular case. Even if\n         such presumption is made, the same is rebuttable and the person is\n         free to lead evidence to rebut such presumption. In such a case, the\n         authority has to consider the evidence and the facts judicially. In this\n         respect, reliance is also placed on the judgments of Rajasthan High\n         Court in the case of Addl. CIT Vs. Thahrayamal Balchand 124 ITR\n         111, 117 (Raj.). What amount of evidence will rebut such a\n         presumption in a given set of facts does not admit of any rigid rule.\n         The evidence may be direct or circumstantial or both and a mere\n         statement of the assessee may be enough in some cases. Therefore, in\n         the facts of the case the presumptions has been rebutted partly with\n         concrete documentary evidences so far as the land deal is concerned\n         and moreover, since the said diary has found from the residence of\n         Shri Arvind A. Shah, the said presumptions cannot be applied in toto\n         in case of the appellant and this. I have no hesitation in deleting the\n         addition with respect to above referred 3 parties and enhancing the\n         addition by Rs.77,47,500/- pertaining to the credit as discussed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_310\">  44.    We are not in agreement with the aforesaid finding of\n  learned CIT(A), especially, under the circumstances when we have\n  taken a view that the transaction in question were nothing but the\n  sharafi transaction. According to us, any credit balance in an\n  account represented the return of loan by the borrower; therefore,\n  we are of the view that the impugned enhancement was not\n  required. We, therefore, hold that ground nos.7 and 8 of the\n  assessee deserves to be allowed because of the reason that learned\n  CIT(A) has considered the transactions in the name of those parties\n  as land transaction. We have taken a conscientious decision that\n  those transactions were the transactions of the assessee. In the\n  result, these two grounds are hereby allowed.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_311\">  45.    Apropos to ground no.10, it is worth to mention that while\n  deciding Revenue's ground no.2 supra we have affirmed the\n  finding of learned CIT(A) as far as the earning of the interest out\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

However, we have restored the\n  issue back to him for the limited purpose that the relief granted\n  therein is required to be reconsidered. On the same lines, we\n  hereby direct to re-compute the correct interest income and\n  requisite relief may be granted. In the result, this ground of the\n  assessee may be treated as allowed for statistical purpose.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_315\">  46.    About ground No.11 of the assessee, we are of the view that\n  learned CIT(A) has already taken a view in favour of the assessee\n  in respect of few parties that those were pertained to the land\n  dealing and not pertained to finance business. Therefore, in the\n  light of the said decision of learned CIT(A) the assessee ought not\n  to have any grievance. But still the assessee has raised this ground.\n  Although, we have not approved the said verdict of learned\n  CIT(A) in respect of those few parties and held that the transaction\n  was connected with the finance business of the assessee, therefore,\n  we are of the view that this ground of the assessee is unwarranted.\n  Rather, we hereby held that this ground has wrongly been taken by\n  the assessee, hence, the same is hereby rejected. In the result, this\n  ground is dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_316\">  47.    Regarding ground No.12, we have noted that the AO had\n  given a working of the negative cash peak; however, the assessee\n  had not submitted any such working or explanation. The only\n  argument of the assessee was that there was no cash deficit and\n  that the cash was withdrawn from the accounts of M/s. Master\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V. Desai Vs.

However, learned CIT(A) has considered those\n  arguments and thereafter came to the conclusion as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">         \"I find that the appellant has made this averment without any basis or\n         evidence. No working as to how assessing officer working was wrong\n         has been given. I also find that this peak has been worked out after\n         giving credit for the balances available with the appellant after\n         making additions as on 1.11.1999 and even that balance is\n         substantially reduced in view of relief allowed earlier. I also find that\n         credit for withdrawals of bank has already been given upto Rs.2.10\n         crores by the assessing office while making addition of Rs.27.32\n         crores. Hence no further claim can be allowed as credit of Rs.2.10\n         crores (Mehsana Account) has already been given. If it is the claim of\n         the appellant that the working was wrong, then it was for him to prove\n         it with evidence and his own working. As the appellant has not come\n         with any details of explanation whatsoever, this addition has got to be\n         confirmed as negative cash peak would appear on liability side of the\n         balance sheet for which no explanation at all has been given by the\n         appellant. It is seen that investment in sharafi business and the peak as\n         worked out in all totals to about Rs.3.14 crores and interest earned for\n         about 1 \u00bd years work out to Rs.1.79 crores. Considering the rate of\n         interest as per the diary which varies between 2 to 4.5% per month,\n         the capital invested would even otherwise work out to more than 5\n         crores, and even if credit for bank loan, as has already been given\n         while working out, then net addition of Rs.27.32 crores by the\n         assessing officer, requirement of own funds cannot be less than\n         Rs.3.14 crores. Considering all these aspects also, addition on\n         account of peak is confirmed.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_320\">  48.    Having heard the submission of both the sides, we have\n  noted that due credit for the withdrawal from the bank had duly\n  given by learned CIT(A). We have also held that the assessee has\n  entered into cash financing; hence, for the purpose of providing\n  cash finance the assessee was in requirement of the cash balance.\n  The deficit of cash thus indicated that the same was nothing but an\n  investment out of undisclosed income. Even, we have noted that\n  learned CIT(A) in the above reproduced paragraph has advanced a\n  reasoning that the assessee was in requirement of own funds;\n  hence, the negative cash peak was rightly taxed by the AO in the\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

It has been the claim of the appellant that entire financing\n         activities has been carried out by M/s Master Developers, which is a\n         partnership firm and in support of this the reliance has been placed on\n         the return of income filed by M/s.

A detailed finding in this regard has also been given in the appeal\n         of Master Developers and in order dated 16.1.2004 it has been held\n         that entries pertain to the appellant.

Since there was no such material found at the time of\n  search that the entries written in the diary were connected with\n  M/s. Master Developers then in such a situation the argument of\n  the assessee has no force. In this connection certain reasoning were\n  rightly given by learned CIT(A), as seen in the above paragraph,\n  hence; the same is hereby affirmed and this ground of the assessee\n  is dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_329\">  51.    In respect of ground no.16, AO had made an addition of\n  Rs.50 lacs in respect of a land situated at Wadaj. The argument of\n  the assessee was that the entire amount was wrongly taxed in the\n  hands of the assessee because in addition to the assessee there\n  were other buyers as well. Only part of the payment was made by\n  the assessee. After considering the evidences and the explanation\n  of the assessee, learned CIT(A) has granted part relief and\n  sustained the addition upto the extent of Rs.1,17,000/- as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">         \"I have considered the facts and gone through the banakhat being\n         loose page 98 to 106 of Annexure A-109 found from the residence of\n         appellant. The said banakhat is executed on 21.10.1995 and there are\n         21 sellers and 6 buyers which includes appellant inter alia. The total\n         value of the land mentioned is Rs.50 lacs and as per para 2 an amount\n         of Rs.5 lacs has been paid and 50% amount is to be paid within a\n         period of 6 months and another 50% within a period of 12 months. As\n         per clause 5, some dispute is undergoing pertaining to the said land\n         and upon the judgment of the said dispute, the title of the lands\n         become clear and marketable. The contention raised before the\n         Assessing Officer is also similar. No evidences have been brought on\n         record by the Assessing Officer that any further payment has been\n         made. Therefore, at the outset, the only payment which can be\n         considered for the purpose of addition is Rs.5 lacs, as found noted in\n         the very same banakhat. Since appellant himself has admitted that\n         total payment is of Rs.7 lacs and 1/6th thereof Rs.1,17,000/- which, has\n         been paid by the appellant and therefore, this amount is required to be\n         considered only as against Rs.50 lacs considered by the Assessing\n         Officer for the purpose of addition. Coming to the source of\n         Rs.1,17,000/- which has been claimed as having been disclosed in\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

The facts in brief as emerged from corresponding\n  assessment order passed u/s.143(3) r.w.s 144/147, dated 14th\n  March, 2005 were that certain evidences were claimed to have\n  been found in respect of the property in Parth Empire Building\n  during the course of search in the case of \"Master Group\". It was\n  noted by the AO that there was declaration of the investment and\n  because of that reason additions were made correspondingly in the\n  hands of one Sri Rajni Desai and in the case of Sri Rajesh Desai in\n  their respective block assessment year. Since the assessee had also\n  made the investment in the same building, therefore, the action\n  was taken against the assessee as well. There was a reference of a\n  valuation report in respect of the impugned property. On the basis\n  of the detection of the impugned property and on the basis the said\n  valuation report the AO has worked out the unexplained\n  investment in those properties as listed in the assessment order at\n  Rs.3,11,97,498/-.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_339\">  57.    When the matter was carried before the First Appellate\n  Authority, it was contested on behalf of the assessee as under:-\n</p><p id=\"p_340\">         \"The addition in the case on the appellant is made mainly on the basis\n         of valuation Report found during the course of search and considered\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

The valuation report pertains to shop\n         No.21 and 22 at first floor of Parth Empire in the name of Ranibhai J.\n         Desai brother of the appellant. The purpose of the said valuation is\n         purely to estimate market value of the property to obtain bank loan on\n         the basis of such valuation &amp; it does not co-relate with cost of\n         acquisition of the property. The actual cost of acquisition of the\n         property shop no.21 &amp; 22 is Rs.731100/- Addition of Rs.4570585/- is\n         made at the assessment order for the block period due to above\n         difference in cost of acquisition &amp; current market value. The value of\n         the said property has appreciated during the period and it does not\n         mean that money has been paid for the said property thereafter. The\n         value of the property as per valuation report is Rs.5915000/-. The said\n         valuation report is taken a base for making addition in the present\n         case. The ratio of value as per valuation report and cost of Acquisition\n         as per books is considered to determine value of the asset for the\n         purpose of addition as per chart shown in the assessment order.\n         Valuation Report of shop No.21 &amp; 22 at Parth Empire is taken to\n         determine value of other assets which is not justified. No valuation\n         report for the property in respect of which addition has been made is\n         found. To take valuation of other assets to make addition for different\n         assets is not justified. The value of the property is estimated on higher\n         side for the sake of obtaining loan from bank and it cannot be taken as\n         base for such huge addition of Rs.31197498/-. The addition as stated\n         above is made on such estimated base and is wholly arbitrary. It is\n         made without considering the real facts of the case and is based on\n         presumption; conjecture not supported by any evidence showing extra\n         investment by appellant and requires to be deleted.\"\n</p>\n<p id=\"p_344\">  57.1 After considering the facts of the case, learned CIT(A) has\n  held as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">         \"The facts in the present case are similar to the facts in the above case\n         before learned CIT(A)-I, Ahmedabad.

Facts in brief as emerged from the corresponding assessment\n  order passed u/s. 147, dated 21.3.2006 were that the AO had noted\n  that while deciding the appeal learned CIT(A) vide order dated\n  23rd December, 2003 had deleted an addition of Rs.2,50,000/-,\n  investment in Shailganga Tenements on the ground that same was\n  not to be taxed in the block assessment but required to be\n  considered in the regular assessment. Due to the said observation\n  of learned CIT(A), the matter was proceeded for the year under\n  consideration in the case of the assessee. The AO had made the\n  addition primarily on the ground that cash withdrawal has\n  explained by the assessee from the bank account of Master\n  Developer for the purpose of investment of Rs.2.5 lacs in\n  Shailganga property was an afterthought. He has concluded as\n  under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">           \"The Department has filed an appeal before Hon'ble ITAT,\n           Ahmedabad against the order of ld.

This gain of sale of land has\n         already been shown in the return of income for A.Y.2001-02 and since\n         the investment has been shown in the balance sheet as at 31.3.2001\n         and investment being out of regular source of income, the question of\n         treating the same as undisclosed or unexplained investment does not\n         arise, the source of investment of Rs.2,50,000/- being fully explained.\"\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_362\">  64.

ON perusal of the CIT(A)'s order dated\n         19.01.2004 in Appeal No.CIT(A)-1/CC.1(1)/24/02-03 in Appellant's\n         own case for the Block Period from 1991-02 to 2001-02 vide para-9\n         on page 88 deciding sixth ground of appeal, it has been noticed that\n         the addition was deleted with the observations that this issue requires\n         to be considered in the regular assessment since the appellant had\n         claimed that this amount in cash was received from the partnership\n         Firm M/s. Master Developers in which appellant is a partner and\n         therefore, the addition made in the block assessment was deleted.\n         Therefore the contention of ld. Counsel that addition of Rs.2,50,000/-\n         was deleted on merits is not borne out from the records and is hereby\n         rejected. Further the appellant had also admitted in his reply dated\n         24.09.2002 that investments were made out of the books by making\n         payment of Rs.2.50 lacs in cash on 29.09.2000. Also the appellant had\n         admitted in reply to question no.17 in his statement dated 20.10.2000\n         given u/s. 132(4) during the search proceedings that the cash book of\n         Master Developers and books of accounts of all the family members\n         were not written from 01.04.2000. Hence, the appellant expressed his\n         inability to explain about the cash deposit and withdrawals in the\n         bank. Keeping in view of above facts and circumstances of the case\n         and also deleting the addition in the block assessment proceedings by\n         the CIT(A)-I(supra), the addition made in regular assessment u/s. 147\n         is hereby confirmed on substantive basis and A.O. is directed\n         accordingly since the appellant failed to explain the sources of\n         investment. Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_363\">  65.    Having heard the submissions of both the sides, we are of\n  the considered opinion that this issue is required to be reconsidered\n  by the AO primarily because of the reason that merely on the basis\n  of the statement it was held that the impugned investment was\n IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                   Jivraj V.

We are, therefore, of the view that the AO must\n  now re-examine the source of the investment as per the records of\n  the assessee and if it is genuine then the assessment should be\n  made as per law. With these observations, this ground being\n  restored back for de novo consideration. Thus, to be treated as\n  allowed for statistical purpose.

For ready reference, the observation of the AO\n  in this connection is reproduced below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">         \"From the ROI and details furnished by the assessee, it has been\n         found that he has received the interest income of Rs.38,08,269/- and\n         interest income of Rs.9,84,872/- in its proprietary concern's account\n         and he has incurred the bank interest exp. of Rs.20,95,947 in its\n         individual account and of Rs.22,30,116 as bank interest and\n         Rs.6,45,891 as interest payable on its proprietary concern's account.\n         Assessee has earned income of Rs.2,58,000/- as rent from Manav\n         Mandir plot, Rs.32,500/- as partner's remuneration income and\n         Rs.72,000/- as rent income. These incomes require no funds and bear\n         no charges against themselves. Still the assessee has filed returned\n         income of Rs.1,14,040/-. Therefore, it is clear that even those receipts\n         which are not related to the financing activity have been wiped out due\n         to the loss in the financing activity. Effectively approximate loss of\n         Rs.1,78,813/- has been claimed from the financing activity. This is not\n         possible at all since this cannot happen in the business of finance if the\n         higher interest bearing funds are not lent at lower rates or when the\n         funds are borrowed at higher rates even when the huge cash balance\n         is lying idle in the cash books. It was also found that the assessee has\n         given the gifts to his family members of Rs.11 lacs to Rameshbhai J.\n         Desai, Rajeshbhai J. Desai, Rajnibhai J. Desai, Alkaben R. Desai,\n         Ashaben R. Desai and Savitaben R. Desai on 20.08.2002 and another\n         gift of Rs.27,00,000 was made to Alkaben R. Desai on 24.12.2002. On\n         one hand the assessee has taken the huge interest bearing funds and\n         on the other he has given the gifts to his family members. In such a\n         situation the claim of interest cannot be allowed to him.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n<p id=\"p_373\">  68.    It was noted by the AO that the interest relates to the amount\n  of gift to the extent to be disallowed @ 18%, which was computed\n  at Rs.2,45,622/- and taxed in the hands of the assessee.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_374\">  69.    When the matter was carried before the First Appellate\n  Authority, learned CIT(A) has confirmed the addition as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">         \"I have carefully considered the contentions as well gone through the\n         records. On perusal of assessment order it has been noticed that gifts\n         were given to closely related persons after obtaining interest funds\n         from and other persons. It means that the assessee had diverted the\n         interest bearing funds to his family members in the form of the gifts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"p_375\">         The gift of Rs.27,00,000/- given to Smt.

Account No.38 of Sarvodya Commercial Co-\n         operative Bank which is charging interest @ 18%. Similarly, the\n         appellant had received transfer of Rs.19,00,000/- from M/s. Master\n         Developers on 20.08.2002 in the Savings Bank Account No.35 of\n         Sarvodaya Commercial Co-operative Bank and on the same day, this\n         amount was given as a gift to various family members from the same\n         account whereas the appellant had paid interest @18% to M/s. Master\n         Developers. Hence, direct nexus has been established that interest\n         bearing funds were diverted either by way of gifts or by way of\n         advances. Therefore, these gifts to the closely related persons cannot\n         be termed as used for the business purposes. Further, if excess funds\n         are given as a gift to close family members then funds borrowed could\n         be considered as not made for purpose of business. In the present\n         case, even though the appellant may have ahd its own funds, these are\n         found to have been given as a gift to the closely related persons which\n         are not for the purpose of business. Hence, these funds are not utilized\n         in the form of gifts during the course of business. Also, specific\n         conditions laid down u/s.36(1)(iii) for allowing such interest are not\n         fulfilled. Keeping in view of above facts and circumstances of the case,\n         the contentions of learned counsel are hereby rejected and first\n         ground of appeal is dismissed.\"\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"p_379\">  70.

Before us, learned AR has\n  vehemently contested that those observations of learned CIT(A)\n  were incorrect factual observation. Learned AR has contested that\n  the learned CIT(A) has mentioned wrong facts. Under this\n  situation when the AO has not made out the case on those facts\n  which were noted by learned CIT(A) and that learned AR is\n  alleging that the facts have wrongly been mentioned by learned\n  CIT(A), we deem it proper to restore this issue back to the file of\n  the AO to be decided de novo after appreciating the correct facts.\n  Side by side, we direct the assessee to place the accounts and the\n  evidences before the AO so that the correct factual position can be\n       IT(ss) Nos.99, 106/Ahd/04 &amp; ITA Nos.2376/Ahd/05 &amp; 3437 &amp; 3438/Ahd/07\n                                         Jivraj V.
